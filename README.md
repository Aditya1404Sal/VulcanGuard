# Vulcan-Guard

## Overview

**Vulcan Guard** is a network management tool designed to test network security and performance. It combines a rate limiter, an eBPF-based XDP (Express Data Path) packet filter, and a load balancer with multiple algorithm support to provide a working firewall solution :D.

## Features

1. **Rate Limiter**:
   - Controls the rate of incoming traffic to prevent overwhelming the network.
   - Protects against DDoS attacks and ensures fair usage of network resources.
   - Supports sticky HTTP session brownlisting: If a valid request with a session ID exceeds a pseudo rate of X requests in Y seconds, the source IP will be temporarily brownlisted (ie: denied service for a set Duration).

2. **eBPF-based XDP Packet Filter**:
   - Utilizes eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) for high-performance packet filtering.
   - Operates at the lowest point in the network stack for minimal latency.
   - Customizable filtering rules to suit specific security needs.

3. **Load Balancer**:
   - **Round Robin Algorithm**:
     - Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple servers.
     - Ensures optimal resource utilization and enhances the performance and reliability of services.

   - **Least Connection Algorithm**:
     - Selects the server with the fewest active connections to distribute incoming traffic.
     - Helps optimize server load balancing by directing requests to the least loaded server.
     - Supports sticky sessions to maintain client-server affinity for HTTP sessions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Linux operating system with kernel version 4.14 or higher.
- `libbpf` library installed.
- `GCC` or `Clang` compiler.
- `Go` version `1.22.0` or higher

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/suboptimal-Firewall.git
   cd suboptimal-Firewall
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```sh
   go build 
   ```
3. Add the binary to the global scope

```bash
#If using zsh
nano ~/.zshrc
#if using bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

and add the path to the binary using

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/complete_path_to_cloned_repo/Suboptimal-firewall"
```

4. Run the firewall:
   ```sh
   sudo Firewall
   ```

5. Stopping The firewall:
   ```sh
   Ctrl+C
   ```

## Configuration

Add a list of backend servers or URLs for Loadbalancing in 
https://github.com/Aditya1404Sal/Suboptimal-firewall/blob/6336a34363dd23fe10c6f9a3aa0cedbd51a6c73a/main.go#L88


### eBPF-based XDP Packet Filter

Modify the eBPF filtering rules in `PacketFilter/pkfilter.c` file according to your usage (Optional) :
```c
SEC("xdp")
int xdp_filter(struct xdp_md *ctx) {
    // Custom filtering logic
    return XDP_PASS;
}
```


## Usage

### Starting the Firewall

To start the firewall with default settings:
```sh
sudo Firewall
```

### Logs and Monitoring

Logs are stored in the root `/` directory. Monitor the firewall status and performance:
```sh
tail -f Firewall.log
```

## Credits

The eBPF-based XDP Packet Filter implementation in this project is inspired by the article ["Simple XDP Firewall with Golang"](https://dev.to/xenbytes/simple-xdp-firewall-with-golang-1da3) by Hasan Behbahani. This article provided a solid foundation upon which I built the dynamic channel-based IP management system, enabling real-time IP blacklisting and automatic unblocking of temporarily blocked IPs.
